Cognifyz_Task_3 — Advanced CSS & Responsive Design
-------------------------------------------------

Files:
- index.html
- css/styles.css
- js/script.js

How to run:
- Open index.html in your browser (double-click) OR serve with a local static server.
- No Node/Express required; this is a static responsive demo that uses Bootstrap CDN.

What this demonstrates:
- Responsive multi-section layout using Bootstrap grid + custom CSS.
- Advanced visual polish: animations, transitions, hover effects, focus states.
- Lightweight client-side form validation with microinteractions.
- Accessibility considerations and semantic HTML.
