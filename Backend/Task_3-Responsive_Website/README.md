Task 3 — Advanced CSS & Responsive Design
-------------------------------------------------

Files:
- index.html
- css/styles.css
- js/script.js

How to run:
- Open index.html in your browser (double-click), or use any local static server.
- No Node.js or Express required — this is a fully static responsive layout.

What this demonstrates:
- Responsive multi-section layout using Bootstrap grid along with custom CSS.
- Advanced visual styling: animations, transitions, hover effects, and focus states.
- Lightweight client-side form validation and interactive UI behavior.
- Semantic HTML structure and basic accessibility considerations.

Notes:
- This project is ideal for practicing modern front-end design patterns.
- Can be improved by adding more components, custom themes, or converting UI into reusable components.
